### Code Style
We're using tabs for indentation so everybode can set their preferred indentation width easily. Javascript is semicolon-less, and css roughly follows BEM/OOCSS naming conventions. Please try to make variable names descriptive and intuitive, and maybe consider dropping a comment or two every now and then.
